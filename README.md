Reducing Paperwork Overload in Clinics4 uptake
Problem Statement:
Clinics in South Africa are overwhelmed with manual patient record keeping, leading to lost files, slow consultations and reduced time for quality care. Health workers spend excessive time on paperwork rather than patient interaction. There is a need for a lightweight friendly system   to digitise key patient data and reduce administrative burden. This system will have a mobile and web access.
Focus Area:
Create a low-cost, scalable solution that digitizes essential patient information and improves clinical workflow in under-resourced PHC facilities.
The system would have an offline feature for incase of a network interruption which would automatical backup the information once internet connection returns. 

Solution:
Create system that will reduce paperwork overload. 
Centrilise patient information onto a secured network for easy access across the healthcare facilities.
