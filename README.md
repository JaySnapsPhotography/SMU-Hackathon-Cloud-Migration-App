Reducing Paperwork Overload in Clinics4 uptake
Problem Statement:
Clinics in South Africa are overwhelmed with manual patient record keeping, leading to lost files, slow consultations, and reduced time for quality care. Health workers spend excessive time on paperwork rather than patient interaction. There is a need for a lightweight, mobile-friendly system to digitise key patient data and reduce administrative burden.
Focus Area:
Create a low-cost, scalable solution that digitizes essential patient information and improves clinical workflow in under-resourced PHC facilities.

Solution:
Create system that will reduce paperwork overload.
